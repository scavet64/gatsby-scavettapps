# Scavettapps Homepage / Personal Portfolio

This webapp is the Scavettapps homepage and personal portfolio for some of my development work. The webapp was built using Gatsby to further my knowledge of the framework and to provide a lighting quick website while still utilizing the benefits of react.

This webapp can be reached by navigating to https://scavettapps.com
